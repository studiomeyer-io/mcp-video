## Unreleased

### Security — wire path/SSRF guards into the tool boundary (2026-06-21)

The prior sweeps *built* `validateFfmpegPath` and `resolveAndGuardUrl` but
left them mostly unconnected: only `narrated-video.ts` validated paths, and
**no** handler used the DNS-resolving URL guard. This release connects the
existing defenses to the actual tool entry points.

- **Flag-injection choke point (`src/lib/sanitize-tool-paths.ts`, NEW).**
  Every path-like argument (`inputPath`, `outputPath`, `videoPath`,
  `musicPath`, `subtitlePath`, `mainVideo`/`overlayVideo`, concat
  `clips[].path`, mixer `tracks[].path`, beat-sync `clips[]`,
  template `clips{}`, chroma-key `background`) is now validated in
  `handleToolCall` before any handler can forward it to ffmpeg/ffprobe.
  A path beginning with `-` (e.g. `outputPath: "-y"`) or containing a NUL
  byte is rejected with a structured tool error instead of being passed to
  ffmpeg as a flag. Output paths previously had **no** existence check, so
  this was a live gap; engine `assertExists` only ever guarded inputs.
  Chroma-key `background` keeps accepting a bare 6-digit hex colour.
- **DNS-rebinding SSRF upgrade.** `record_website_video`,
  `record_website_scroll`, `record_multi_device`, `create_narrated_video`,
  `screenshot_element` and `detect_page_features` now use the async
  `resolveAndGuardUrl` (DNS-resolves the host and rejects internal IPs)
  instead of the sync `guardUrl` (literal-host only). Closes the bypass
  where a public hostname resolves to `127.0.0.1` / `169.254.169.254`.
  `MCP_VIDEO_ALLOW_INTERNAL=1` still bypasses for local dev and is now
  documented in the README config table.

**Tests:** +41 (104 → 145, all green), tsc clean. New
`sanitize-tool-paths.test.ts` (attack-blocked + benign-allowed per field
shape) + `handlers/dispatch.test.ts` (end-to-end choke point) +
`url-guard-resolve.test.ts` (DNS-rebind, mocked `node:dns/promises`) +
`runFfprobe` coverage added to `ffmpeg-run.test.ts` (the security-critical
probe runner was previously untested).

### Fixed — Cross-platform ffmpeg detection (issue #11, 2026-05-07)

- **Windows startup failure**: `checkDependencies()` previously called
  `execFileSync('which', [bin])` to verify ffmpeg/ffprobe presence. `which`
  is a Unix-only command, so the check failed on Windows even when ffmpeg
  was on PATH and runnable. Reported by [@Firelods](https://github.com/Firelods)
  in [#11](https://github.com/studiomeyer-io/mcp-video/issues/11).
- **`FFMPEG_PATH` / `FFPROBE_PATH` env overrides now actually work at
  runtime**, not only in error-message text. The previous implementation
  spawned `execFile('ffmpeg', ...)` directly inside `ffmpeg-run.ts`, so
  setting the env var was ignored at every spawn site. The original
  reporter confirmed this on the issue thread.

**New module:** `src/lib/ffmpeg-bin.ts` exposes `resolveFfmpegBin()` (env
override → bare-name fallback) and `assertFfmpegBinAvailable()` (probe via
`<bin> -version`, no shell, `windowsHide: true`). Both `server.ts`
startup-check and `ffmpeg-run.ts` runtime spawn now go through the same
helper, so the override stays consistent.

15 new regression tests + the original test suite (104/104 green); typecheck
clean. Thanks to [@Firelods](https://github.com/Firelods) for the detailed
environment + reproduction.

### Security — Round-4 OSS-Sweep (2026-04-24)

- **`server.ts` dependency check**: replaced `execSync(\`which ${bin}\`)`
  shell-interpolation with `execFileSync('which', [bin], ...)`. The input
  was already a hardcoded literal array, so no real exposure today — this
  is defense-in-depth so a future refactor that makes the list
  config-driven can't turn into a command-injection sink. 89/89 tests
  still green, tsc clean.

### Security — hardening sweep (Session 840, 2026-04-21)

Four of the five Session 837 Must-Fix items plus the three Session 839
follow-up findings (DNS-rebinding, ffmpeg hop-2 SSRF, redirect following)
are now addressed in one coherent patch. 42 new tests; 89/89 green.

**Post-review follow-through (Session 840 Agent Critic):**

A full triple-agent review (Analyst + Critic + Research) caught one
remaining bypass: every engine still had a LOCAL `runFfmpeg` function that
delegated to the safe runner, but five engines (`audio.ts`,
`audio-mixer.ts`, `beat-sync.ts`, `editing.ts`, `voice-effects.ts`) ALSO
called `ffprobe` directly via `execFile('ffprobe', ...)` — and `ffprobe`
follows HLS/DASH playlists just like `ffmpeg` does. The "just probe it
first" path was a complete SSRF bypass.

- `src/lib/ffmpeg-run.ts` gains `runFfprobe(args, opts, resolver)` —
  same discipline as `runFfmpeg`: prepend `-protocol_whitelist`, sanitize
  stderr, label for rejection messages. Every `ffprobe` call across the
  five engines now routes through it.
- `narrated-video.ts` internal `runFfmpeg` helper now delegates to the
  central safe runner (was still using its own `execFile` wrapper from
  the first pass of the sweep).
- All thirteen engines drop their `import { execFile } from 'child_process'`
  now that the last consumer is gone.

**`src/lib/url-guard.ts` — DNS resolution + IPv6-mapped IPv4 + final URL check**

- New async `resolveAndGuardUrl(raw)` uses `dns.lookup(family:0)` and
  rejects any hostname that resolves to a loopback / RFC1918 / link-local
  IP. Catches the naive DNS-rebinding case where a public hostname
  resolves to `127.0.0.1` at lookup time.
- New `guardFinalUrl(raw)` is called AFTER `page.goto()` on the URL the
  browser actually landed on — 302 redirects to internal metadata
  endpoints are now blocked at the post-navigation checkpoint.
- `BLOCKED_HOST_PATTERNS` now matches the full `fc00::/7` ULA range
  (previously only `fc00:`, missing `fd00:`-`fdff:`).
- IPv6-mapped IPv4 (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`, `::ffff:7f00:1`, and
  `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` — all three forms the WHATWG URL parser
  can produce) are now explicitly blocked.

**`src/lib/ffmpeg-safety.ts` — protocol whitelist + flag-injection guard (NEW)**

- `buildFfmpegArgs(args, set)` prepends `-protocol_whitelist` to every
  ffmpeg invocation. Three protocol sets cover all internal use:
  `local-only` (file+pipe+crypto+cache+fd), `https-input` (adds
  https+tls+tcp for one-top-level-URL), `https-and-hls` (adds hls for
  master+segment playback). `http://` is in none of them — forces TLS
  for any network-bound ffmpeg read.
- `validateFfmpegPath(p, label)` rejects values starting with `-`
  (turns `-i /etc/passwd ...` smuggled as "filename" into an error) and
  null-byte injections. `validateFfmpegPaths(args, indices)` applies
  the check to specific user-controlled positions in an args array.

**`src/lib/ffmpeg-run.ts` — central ffmpeg runner (NEW)**

- Every engine (audio, audio-mixer, beat-sync, chroma-key, concat,
  editing, encoder, lut-presets, narrated-video, social-format,
  template-renderer, text-animations, text-overlay, voice-effects —
  14 call sites across 13 files) now routes through `runFfmpeg()`,
  which injects `-protocol_whitelist` + sanitizes stderr before it
  reaches logs or thrown errors. `resolver: 'stderr'` lets beat-sync
  still pick up its filter-info output.

**`src/lib/temp-dir.ts` — safe mkdtemp helper (NEW)**

- `withTempDir(prefix, fn)` wraps `fs.mkdtemp` + try/finally cleanup so
  a crash or throw inside `fn` still removes the directory. Replaces
  the predictable `/tmp/narrated-video-${Date.now()}` pattern in
  `tools/engine/narrated-video.ts` that raced when two invocations
  hit the same millisecond and leaked on SIGTERM.

**`src/lib/error-sanitizer.ts` — upstream-API secret scrub (NEW)**

- `sanitizeErrorMessage(raw, opts)` strips seven secret shapes before
  ffmpeg stderr or TTS-provider error bodies land in logs or thrown
  errors: Bearer tokens, `xi-api-key` / `x-api-key` header values,
  OpenAI `sk-` keys, AWS `AKIA...`, generic `"api_key"` JSON fields,
  Authorization headers (with a negative lookahead so already-redacted
  Bearer markers survive), and signed-URL `X-Amz-Signature` params.
  Length-capped at 300 chars by default.

**`src/handlers/tts.ts` — missing SSRF guard on `create_narrated_video`**

- Session 837 wrapped three video handlers in `guardUrl` but skipped
  `create_narrated_video`. That handler now guards `args.url` the same
  way as the other three — Playwright + ffmpeg no longer see
  unvalidated URLs.

**`src/tools/engine/capture.ts` + `smart-screenshot.ts` — post-redirect guard**

- Each `page.goto()` is now followed by `guardFinalUrl(page.url())`.
  If the browser followed a 302 to an internal host (classic SSRF
  escalation path via open redirect on a public domain), the engine
  throws before rendering frames or saving screenshots.

**`src/tools/engine/narrated-video.ts` — withTempDir + safe ffmpeg**

- `createNarratedVideo` now uses `withTempDir` instead of the
  predictable timestamp-based path. Its inner `runFfmpeg` helper routes
  through the central safe runner. Concat list generation escapes
  single quotes in file names before writing the concat list file.

### Added — url-guard test suite

- **`src/lib/url-guard.test.ts`** (38 tests) locks in every branch of
  `guardUrl()`, including the classic SSRF-filter evasion encodings. All
  pass because Node's WHATWG URL parser normalises them before the regex
  check sees the hostname; the tests exist so a future parser change,
  regex tweak, or refactor can't silently re-open the hole.

  Covered bypass vectors: decimal IPv4 (`http://2130706433/`), hex IPv4
  (`0x7f000001`), octal IPv4 (`0177.0.0.1`), short-form IPv4 (`127.1`),
  bare zero (`http://0/`), IPv6-mapped IPv4 (`[::ffff:127.0.0.1]` plus
  its compact `[::ffff:7f00:1]` and expanded forms).

  Plus full coverage of the scheme allow-list (rejects `file://`, `ftp://`,
  `gopher://`, `data:`, `javascript:`), private ranges, link-local
  (including the AWS/GCP/Azure metadata endpoint at `169.254.169.254`),
  IPv6 `::1` / fc00::/7 ULA / fe80::/10 link-local, and the
  `MCP_VIDEO_ALLOW_INTERNAL` escape hatch (strict equality on `"1"` —
  `"true"` / `"yes"` / `"0"` do not open the door).
